## REST API for notes sharing

### Introduction

This is a notes sharing app where users can follow and view their friends' notes.
There can be multiple clients accessing the server simultaneously.

### Features (ideas for now)
 - Create notes with a title and text or image.
 - Share notes with friends by sending a notification or by sending an email.
 - Follow friends' activities as they create notes
 - Have a private and public repository for notes

### How to run
Installing dependencies: 

I think we will have to focus on authentication especially, and maybe concurrency?

Routes will be triggered directly only using URLs

URLs can be redirected - using triggers
